Stood 8/16 with approx ~96% accuracy

# PS: multiclass image classification for crop disease
Farmers all around the world have vast acreages and confront the challenge of crop monitoring on a regular basis. To design an algorithm that would assist them in monitoring their crops and in informing farmers about crop health.
According to health, it will classify diseases. To assist with this, you must construct a machine learning model that classifies disease.
To assist you, we have provided dataset with four classifications; now it's up to you to design an ML model.


# Solution:

* Trained VGG16 from scratch for 50 epochs.
* ~ 97% accuracy on validation dataset (25% data from training set).
* ~ 96% accuracy on 25% test dataset.
* ~ 92% accuracy on remaining 75% test dataset.
